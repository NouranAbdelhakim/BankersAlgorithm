# Banker's Algorithm - Resource Management
This Windows Forms application, developed using C# and .NET Framework, implements the Banker's algorithm to manage resources in a system. It allows users to enter resource allocation and process information, and calculates whether the system is in a safe state. If the system is safe, it displays the safe sequence of processes.
